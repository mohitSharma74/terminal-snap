# TerminalSnap – Product Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of TerminalSnap in clearly defined phases.  
Each phase builds on the previous one, focusing first on **core usability**, then **output quality**, followed by **visual polish and awareness**, and finally **feedback loops**.

The goal is to keep TerminalSnap simple, reliable, and developer-first.

---

## Phase 0 — Core Stability & Trust

**Objective:**  
Make TerminalSnap feel complete, predictable, and worth returning to.

### Features
- Persist user configuration (theme, font, background, etc.)
- Change terminal fonts (curated monospace options)
- Copy to clipboard (image output)

### Expectations After This Phase
- Users can return to TerminalSnap and get consistent results
- The tool feels reliable rather than experimental
- Core workflows (customize → export → share) are frictionless
- TerminalSnap earns basic trust as a daily-usable utility

---

## Phase 0.5 — First Impression & Clarity

**Objective:**  
Ensure users understand what TerminalSnap does within seconds and enjoy using it.

### Features
- UI redesign (simple, compact, accessible; spiritually inspired by Carbon)
- Updated visual assets (logo, banners, social previews)
- Short demo video showcasing core usage

### Expectations After This Phase
- New users immediately grasp the value of TerminalSnap
- The UI feels calm, focused, and developer-centric
- README, website, and social previews look credible and intentional
- Increased likelihood of stars, bookmarks, and sharing

---

## Phase 1 — Output & Portability

**Objective:**  
Make TerminalSnap outputs usable everywhere developers write or publish.

### Features
- Export to SVG (first-class output)
- Open exports in new tab
- Shareable links
- Embed support (iframe)

### Expectations After This Phase
- TerminalSnap outputs integrate cleanly into blogs, docs, and READMEs
- SVG becomes the preferred, high-quality format
- Sharing is link-based rather than platform-dependent
- Foundations are in place for future IDE or tooling integrations

---

## Phase 1.5 — Engagement & Discovery

**Objective:**  
Encourage exploration and increase time-on-tool without adding complexity.

### Features
- Randomize button (theme + background + font)
  - Uses curated, readable combinations
  - Respects persisted configuration

### Expectations After This Phase
- Users discover new styles effortlessly
- The tool feels more playful without losing seriousness
- Increased experimentation and share-worthy outputs

---

## Phase 2 — Visual Expansion

**Objective:**  
Differentiate TerminalSnap visually while keeping clarity and accessibility intact.

### Features
- More terminal themes and backgrounds
- Custom background functionality (with guardrails)
- Hand-drawn / Excalidraw-styled terminal themes

### Expectations After This Phase
- TerminalSnap stands out visually among similar tools
- Users can express personality without sacrificing readability
- Community contributions (themes/backgrounds) become easier to accept

---

## Phase 2.5 — Product Awareness

**Objective:**  
Keep users informed about improvements without being intrusive.

### Features
- Notification bell in the UI
  - Indicates when new functionality is added
  - Links to the GitHub changelog
  - Uses local state (no backend, no accounts)

### Expectations After This Phase
- Users are aware that the project is actively maintained
- Improvements don’t go unnoticed
- Communication remains lightweight and OSS-friendly

---

## Phase 3 — Feedback Loop

**Objective:**  
Collect structured feedback once the core experience is stable.

### Features
- New feature request flow (GitHub-based)
  - Clear templates and categories
  - Emphasis on signal over noise

### Expectations After This Phase
- Feedback becomes actionable rather than overwhelming
- Community input helps guide future work
- The project evolves with user needs, not guesswork

---

## Out of Scope (For Now)

- IDE extensions
- Authentication or user accounts
- Cloud storage or syncing
- Monetization
- Analytics dashboards

These may be explored in the future once the core experience is mature and widely adopted.
